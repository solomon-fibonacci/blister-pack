## Talking to users

The goal is to extract information. So talk about your life, not about your idea.
Extract information that will help you:
1. improve your product
2. improve your marketing
3. improve your positioning


Talk about specifics, not hypotheticals. Talk about speifics of problems that have already occured.

Figure out the path that led them to encounter that problem? 
Gain context, learn about their motivation


Listen, don't talk.

5 great questions to ask:

1. What is the hardest part about doing [x,y,z]? where x,y,z is related to a task that your target user
    wants to accomplish. 
    // This can also help us think about 
    your target user in a personal sense. Even though we want to sell to businesses, it helps to know 
    who exactly will make the decision. The task has to be related to something they want to accomplish 
    for their business or in their role, and that's how you get to them. 
      
      ``` figure out 3 [x,y,z]s that Lykdat can solve```
    
2. Tell me about the last time you encountered this problem? 

3. Why was it hard? Answers to this can inform marketing and sale copy

4. What have you tried to do? Why didn't it work? If the problem is burning enough, they'll have tried to solve it another way

5. What don't you love about what you already use? Don't ask for features. Henry Ford: "Our users would have wanted a faster horse instead of a car"



Finding your first users:
- Start with yourself: Walk through a situation where you've encountered that problem.
- Use friends and coworkers to get warm introductions.
- Drop by in person! Figure out the where? decide the when!
- Industry events.


Execute a few interviews that are unbiased and detailed


Tips
- Take notes
- Keep it casual
- Careful about their time


Figure out your first best customer is. Wrong one can trap you. Can lead you down a long road that won't earn you a lot of money
> How much does this problem cost them today? Revenue lost, or cost

> How frequently do they encounter this problem? Usage volume gives you good feedback

> How large is their budget for solving this problem? Ability to fix (money / authority)
