# Is it REALLY pivoting?
It's not a pivot if you're really early stage. You're just iterating on your idea. 
It should be lightweight, and it should happen really fast as often as you learn. 

Reasons to pivot:
- opportunity cost
- it's not growing
- i hate working on it 
- I'm not the right person for the idea
- I'm realying on an external factor outside my control for it to take off!
- Out of ideas on what to do differently to make it work.

Bad reasons to pivot:
- Trying to run away from doing hard work
- You change your mind chronically 


Most people take too long to pivot, why?
- Loss oversion
- A bit of traction
- Politeness of others/potential customers
- Fear of admitting weakness/defeat


> We should be trying different ideas rapidly enough. Yes, maybe finding a way to use some of the things we've built
but not trying to build on top of something that doesn't really work.


# How to find a better Idea
- Find something you're more excited about. Do something inspirational. Acutally help [y e.g small businesses] do [x]
- Honest assessment of what you're good and bad at.
- Something that you can quickly build, ship and validate. 


> Have a good idea about whether your businesses is VC backable. 

# *"Idea quality score"*
Some criteria to use in evaluating.
- how big of an idea it seems to be. Which examples of billion dollar organisations can you point to that have done something similar and your product is going to make your company like them. e.g Tesla and car companies
- founder/market fit.
- how easy is it to get started.
- early market feedback from customers.

```Closing thoughts
> Let's think about IGDM, what can we learn from that? IT was literally free and open source, but people asking for more is what led to it being a source of income? What can we port from that idea?
> If we're not going to change lykdat.com to pure b2b cos we think it's a different audience, who are we moving the banner up for?
> We really should be taling to ONE (group of) person(s): "TARGET AUDIENCE". It's easier to understand who we're talking to if we're talking to one person.```
